linguisticsweb code examples

This repository is designed to serve as a home to all kinds of code examples accpmpanying software tutorials offered on its parent site linguisticsweb.org. The repository hosts batch files for driving terminal based software, programming examples again predominantly for the purpose of driving software and workflows from programming languages, esp. Python. Generally, these code snippets are designed to serve as examples of how to do things programmatically such as driving natural language processing software for automatic annotation. The code snippets also contain working examples of pattern searches etc. that are designed for linguistic corpus analyses.
This repository is work in progress and has only just been set up as of late December 2018, so please allow for a little time until it is populated.
